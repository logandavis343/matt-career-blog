## Zeekee Interactive ( October 2007 - June 2013 )

In October of 2007 a close friend of mine set me up an interview at Zeekee Interactive. I recall it being one of the least stressful interviews I have ever had, mostly because it had been so long since I had worked with HTML that I felt there was no way I would get the job. They sat me at a computer and asked me to perform some task and I left having accomplished nothing after 3 hours. The next day I received a phone call from them letting me know I was hired, and it only took a week or two before they felt comfortable letting me build sites from start to finish. The web was a very different place back then; most of the dozens of websites I built in the early days at Zeekee were elaborately designed but easily put together by cutting up a PSD into a bunch of images and reconstructing it using HTML/CSS.

The few dynamic sites we built depended on a proprietary CMS created by a one man shop out of Atlanta. None of the employees at Zeekee could code and the company depended on him for the integration of this CMS into the sites along with any customizations we needed. This was a difficult business relationship and I was asked one day to make a simple change to the checkout process on a client's online store. After making the change I started to feel comfortable digging around in the CMS and quickly became familiar with PHP's syntax.

Our partner in Atlanta was hard to work with and would fabricate reasons to delay changes or avoid making them entirely. I soon found that if I dug through his code and explained exactly how to make the changes he had no choice but to implement them. Before long I had the dubious honor of being the only person with the patience and knowledge to communicate with him.

This turned out to be the perfect situation for me to learn. I was forced to come up with creative ways to implement functionality requested by the customer without making any changes that would be overwritten. Sometime in 2009 everything "clicked" and I came to understand how the frontend, PHP, and MySQL could be used together to build a web application. There was nothing I couldn't build with enough time.

By 2011 I had built a lot of different types of sites - social media, online stores, real estate. I turned the default cart provided by the CMS into a single page application using jQuery and integrated Google analytics into it. I was comfortable working with APIs. At this point I was involved with nearly every new client we had, and my boss trusted me to accurately quote hours and explain everything that would be involved in the creation of their site. The company grew with me - every time I learned something new our salespeople had something new they could offer to potential clients.

By 2012 I began teaching some of the other employees to code, and most of them are still developers today. This was the year I realized that I truly loved what I was doing and decided to drop my goal of returning to UAB to finish studying biology. 

In 2013 several different things combined that started me on a path spiraling downward. For the first time I was faced with a project I didn't know how to approach. It was an enterprise scale application for a regional brokerage firm and was simply too large for me to complete on my own in a reasonable time frame. I had never said no to my boss and I wasn't about to start. At the same time I was in and out of a terrible relationship. I also shattered my calcaneous - a serious injury that took me over 6 months to recover from. The anxiety I had already struggled with became crippling, and rather than seeking help I looked for a quick fix on my own using benzodiazepines. 

The medication relieved my anxiety, but also removed my inhibitions. I stopped taking my job seriously and ignored any criticism or advice. After several months of heavy self-medication I realized I was heading in the wrong direction and abruptly stopped. I was physically dependent at this point, and I had a seizure while working. I fell into a deep depression afterward and my relationship with my boss deteriorated because of my newly poor attitude and work ethic. I knew that the seizure was caused by withdrawal from the medication, but I was afraid to admit that I had been using it. This meant that I was not treated for my anxiety, and after a couple of weeks I started self-medicating again.

Although it didn't end well, I wouldn't trade my time at Zeekee for anything. In many ways today things are similar to my situation in 2007. I have the same drive, work ethic, and ability that I had at 19 but I have also been through a great deal and matured as a result. Zeekee Interactive benefited tremendously from taking a chance on me then, and there is an opportunity for someone to benefit from taking a chance on me now.

### Infomedia ( June 2013 - October 2013 )

In June of 2013 [Infomedia](https://infomedia.com/contact/) hired me to be a Wordpress developer. Most of my time there was spent troubleshooting existing sites and coming up with ways to use Wordpress to meet specific requests for functionality rather than building entire sites from scratch. Infomedia was exclusively a Wordpress shop and I became much more familiar with it as a result.

### [](https://www.luckie.com)Luckie & Company ( October 2013 - April 2014 )

Sometime in 2013 I had an interview with a local JRuby shop that asked me to build a Ruby on Rails application to demonstrate that I wasn't a "one trick pony" as they put it. They wanted to see that I could learn to develop using something other than PHP/MySQL, so I built a simple workout tracking application at <http://humungus.herokuapp.com> to prove my versatility. They didn't end up hiring me, but I did become familiar enough with Ruby on Rails to get a job at [Luckie](https://www.luckie.com) as a developer. I was hired to work with both Wordpress and RoR, but nearly all of my time was spent maintaining RoR applications we built for Bayer. In addition to becoming familiar with RoR, I was introduced to version control systems and became comfortable with their use.

I also helped troubleshoot Wordpress sites and assist other developers who weren't sure how to tackle a problem. This has been a theme throughout my all of my career - people generally come to view me as a resource they can come to when they have a problem.

### The Dark Ages ( April 2014 - 2018 )

In mid 2014 my mental health began to rapidly deteriorate. I had set the bar for myself incredibly high as a teenager, and I came to believe that I was a failure. More importantly I was taking extremely high doses of benzodiazepines every day. The combination of these two things caused me to fall deeper into depression, and as a result I quit my job at Luckie with little explanation. No one, including my family, had any idea what was going on. I began drinking alcohol with the benzodiazepines which caused me to black out regularly, and seizures from withdrawal were not uncommon. During these years I was either unemployed or working jobs not related to tech. By 2018 I had stopped abusing benzodiazepines but began drinking very heavily, replacing one addiction with another.

### Provalus ( February 2018 - August 2018 )

In February I found out about a free coding bootcamp provided by a company called Provalus in Brewton, AL. They have an interesting business model - outsourcing developers in small towns with a low cost of living to work remotely for U.S. companies. I would spend 40 hours a week training to become a full-stack developer for 9 weeks. At the end of the 9 weeks the three students with the highest grade would be paid a low wage to develop in-house applications until a client looking for development work could be located. 

By now I had developed a fear that I might have damaged my mind to the point that I would be unable to get back into coding. I saw this as an opportunity to prove to myself otherwise, and I was very successful. I finished the bootcamp with the highest grade, and I had no difficulty learning to build web applications using C# and .NET Core. Unfortunately the wage they paid was not sufficient for me to live on my own and I moved back to Birmingham to search for a job. I didn't have any luck, but in retrospect that was for the best - without tackling my addiction I would have been setting myself up for failure.

### Present Day

By 2019 my alcoholism had progressed to a terrible point. My life revolved around drinking and nothing else, and my doctor made it clear that if I continued on that path it would kill me. After another withdrawal seizure I was broken. I finally conceded that I couldn't do it on my own and found help.

At the time of writing this I have been free from substance abuse for several months for the first time in seven years. In addition to this blog and a portfolio I am training to become a manager at a local sandwich shop to demonstrate that I am capable of holding down a job with a variety of responsibilities. 

The underlying issues that led me to start self-medicating have been treated, and I am happier now than I was even before I fell into addiction. I still love to code, and I have the same work ethic and ability to learn that I had when I first started. If you are an employer looking for someone with a strong drive to work and learn, give me a call at 205-919-6278 or email me at matt@logandavis.org. I am extremely eager to get back to doing what I love and you won't be disappointed!
