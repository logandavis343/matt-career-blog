## Zeekee Interactive ( October 2007 - June 2013 )

In October of 2007 a close friend of mine set me up an interview at Zeekee Interactive. I recall it being one of the least stressful interviews I have ever had, mostly because it had been so long since I had worked with HTML that I felt there was no way I would get the job. They sat me at a computer and asked me to perform some task and I left having accomplished nothing after 3 hours. The next day I received a phone call from them letting me know I was hired, and it only took a week or two before they felt comfortable letting me build sites from start to finish. The web was a very different place back then; most of the dozens of websites I built in the early days at Zeekee were elaborately designed but easily put together by cutting up a PSD into a bunch of images and reconstructing it using HTML/CSS.

The few dynamic sites we built depended on a proprietary CMS created by a one man shop out of Atlanta. None of the employees at Zeekee could code and the company depended on him for the integration of this CMS into the sites along with any customizations we needed. This was a difficult business relationship and I was asked one day to make a simple change to the checkout process on a client's online store. After making the change I started to feel comfortable digging around in the CMS and quickly became familiar with PHP's syntax.

Our partner in Atlanta was hard to work with and would fabricate reasons to delay changes or avoid making them entirely. I soon found that if I dug through his code and explained exactly how to make the changes he had no choice but to implement them. Before long I had the dubious honor of being the only person with the patience and knowledge to communicate with him.

*This turned out to be the perfect situation for me to learn. I was forced to come up with creative ways to implement functionality requested by the customer without making any changes that would be overwritten. Sometime in 2009 everything "clicked" and I came to understand how the frontend, PHP, and MySQL could be used together to build a web application. There was nothing I couldn't build with enough time.*

By 2011 I had built a lot of different types of sites - social media, online stores, real estate. I turned the default cart provided by the CMS into a single page application using jQuery and integrated Google analytics into it. I was comfortable working with APIs. At this point I was involved with nearly every new client we had, and my boss trusted me to accurately quote hours and explain everything that would be involved in the creation of their site. The company grew with me - every time I learned something new our salespeople had something new they could offer to potential clients.

By 2012 I began teaching some of the other employees to code, and most of them are still developers today. This was the year I realized that I truly loved what I was doing and decided to drop my goal of returning to UAB to finish studying biology. 

In 2013 several different things combined that set me on a path spiraling downward. For the first time I was faced with a project I didn't know how to approach. It was an enterprise scale application for a regional brokerage firm and was simply too large for me to complete on my own in a reasonable time frame. I had never said no to my boss and I wasn't about to start. At the same time I was in and out of a terrible relationship. I also shattered my calcaneous - a serious injury that took me over 6 months to recover from. The anxiety I had already struggled with became crippling and rather than attempting to treat it properly I looked for a quick fix using benzodiazepines. 

My anxiety vanished along with all of my inhibitions. I stopped taking my job seriously and ignored any criticism or advice. After several months of heavy self-medication I realized I was heading in the wrong direction and abruptly stopped. I was physically dependent at this point, and I had a seizure while working. I fell into a deep depression afterward and my relationship with my boss deteriorated because of my newly poor attitude and work ethic. I was offered a job at Infomedia in June, which I immediately accepted.
