## Zeekee Interactive ( October 2007 - June 2013 )

In October of 2007 a close friend of mine set me up an interview at Zeekee Interactive. I recall it being one of the least stressful interviews I have ever had, mostly because it had been so long since I had worked with HTML that I felt there was no way I would get the job. They sat me at a computer and asked me to perform some task and I left having accomplished nothing after 3 hours. The next day I received a phone call from them letting me know I was hired, and it only took a week or two before they felt comfortable letting me build sites from start to finish. The web was a very different place back then; most of the dozens of websites I built in the early days at Zeekee were elaborately designed but easily put together by cutting up a PSD into a bunch of images and reconstructing it using HTML/CSS.

The few dynamic sites we built depended on a proprietary CMS created by a one man shop out of Atlanta. None of the employees at Zeekee could code and the company depended on him for the integration of this CMS into the sites along with any customizations we needed. This was a difficult business relationship and I was asked one day to make a simple change to the checkout process on a client's online store. After making the change I started to feel comfortable digging around in the CMS and quickly became familiar with PHP's syntax.

Before long I had the dubious honor of being the only person with the patience and knowledge to communicate with him.

This turned out to be the perfect situation for me to learn. Sometime in 2009 everything "clicked" and I found myself able to understand how the frontend, PHP, and MySQL were used together to build a web application. I understood the CMS as well as the creator did, and
