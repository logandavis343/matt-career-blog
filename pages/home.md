## About me
In the year 2000 at 11 years old I discovered a forum online while looking up cheat codes for my favorite video game. I was homeschooled at the time with almost no contact with anyone outside of my family. When someone replied to my first post I was ecstatic - the internet became my connection with the outside world and I was completely enthralled by it. I immediately began building websites of my own and found employment doing the same thing seven years later at a company called Zeekee Interactive. I taught myself to code and advanced rapidly until things took a rapid turn downward.

## What happened?
I fell into substance abuse around the age of 24. It didn't take long for things to come apart. I lost nearly all of my professional relationships and burned every bridge I crossed with my reckless behavior. I continued to find jobs without resolving my biggest problem which only damaged my reputation further.

## What's the purpose of this site?
Things made a turn for the better! I have no desire to make my history with substance abuse a part of my identity but there is simply no way to hide the colossal impact of something that dominated so much of my adult life. 

I miss doing what I love for a living. Despite building dozens of websites for names like American Family Care and Rick & Bubba there is no longer evidence online that I built anything. I intend to change that here by recording my journey back into coding on [my blog page](https://www.logandavis.org/blog/). The posts will contain thoughts I have as I use the plethora of learning resources out there to refresh my memory of what I already understand and to learn new things. I will do my best to make them entertaining, but ultimately the point is to demonstrate my interest in coding and my ability to learn.

Thanks for checking in!
