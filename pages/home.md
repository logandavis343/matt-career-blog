## About me
In the year 2000 at 11 years old I discovered a forum online while looking up cheat codes for my favorite video game. I was homeschooled at the time with almost no contact with anyone outside of my family. When someone replied to my first post I was ecstatic - the internet became my connection with the outside world and I was completely enthralled by it. I immediately began building websites of my own and found employment doing the same thing seven years later at a company called Zeekee Interactive. I taught myself to code and advanced rapidly until things took a rapid turn downward.

## What happened?
I fell into substance abuse around the age of 24. It didn't take long for things to come apart. I lost nearly all of my professional relationships and burned every bridge I crossed with my reckless behavior. I continued to find jobs without resolving my biggest problem which only damaged my reputation further.

## What's the purpose of this site?
There is simply no way to tell my story with a resume and cover letter. After I left Zeekee in 2013 my life was dominated by my addictions and all career decisions I made were influenced by them. At most places I simply was unable to perform my job, and trying to rationalize years of irrational decisions to a potential employer or recruiter is mentally exhausting and mostly a waste of time. Whatever I can recall from my time spent at those jobs that would be of interest to an employer is on [my job history page](https://www.logandavis.org/history/).

Now that I am free from addiction I want to get back to doing what I love for a living - coding. Despite building dozens of websites for names like American Family Care and Rick & Bubba there is no longer evidence online that I built anything. The purpose of this site is to change that. I will be recording my progress as I work through tutorials to refresh my memory of technologies I am already familiar with as well as ones I am interested in learning. So if you are interested in seeing where I'm at, head over to [my blog page](https://www.logandavis.org/blog/), and thanks for checking in!
